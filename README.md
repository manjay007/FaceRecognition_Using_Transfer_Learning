# FaceRecognition_Using_Transfer_Learning
## Processes I followed are :
* 1. At first I downloaded the haarcascade_frontalface dataset from internet using python code.Then it tooked 100 image of the face and saved it in the given path. I used this same code twice so that two different images of faces save in two different folders.
* 2. Then I used the pre-created python file of mobilenet and added my own code to add some new layers to do Transfer Learning.
* 3. Then I fitted my dataset and build the model. Then I saved the model.
* 4. Lastly I loaded the saved model and did the prediction.
