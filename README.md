# FaceRecognition_Using_Transfer_Learning
## Processes I followed are :
* 1. At first I downloaded the haarcascade_frontalface dataset from internet using python code.Then it tooked 100 image of the face and saved it in the given path. I used this two times so that two different face data save in two different folder.
* 2. Then I used the pre-created python file of mobilenet and add my own code to add some new layers to do Transfer Learning.
* 3. Then I fit my dataset and start to build the model. Then I save the model.
* 4. Lastly I load the saved model and do the prediction.
