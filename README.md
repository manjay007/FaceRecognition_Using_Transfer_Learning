# FaceRecognition_Using_Transfer_Learning
## Processes I followed are :
* 1. At first I collect the raw images from internet. Then I rename them and also change there format to jpg. Next I classify them and store them in respective folders. This is how I build the dataset.
* 2. Then I used the pre-created python file of VGG16 and add my own code to add some new layers to do Transfer Learning.
* 3. Then I fit my dataset and start to build the model. Then I save the model.
* 4. Lastly I load the saved model and do the prediction.
